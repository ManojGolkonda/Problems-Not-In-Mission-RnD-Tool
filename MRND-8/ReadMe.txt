Questions:

1. barberShopQueue.c : Given an array consisting integer values which represent the time taken by barber at that specified shop.There is a queue outside the shop. Given one customer in the queue at some position. We have to find the shop to which the customer need to go.

2. binarySortRot.c : There is a sorted array in ascending order. The input is the array rotated to left or right based on requirement by specified number of position. We need to find the given key element in the rotated array given array and length of the array are inputs.

3. isoMorphicStr.c : Two strings are given as input. We have to find those to are isomorphic or not. Isomorphic means they follow the same pattern. Assuming that there are two sets i.e a-z and A-Z only. After z the series will repeat from a, same for another set also. Elements in one set are isomorphic only with the elements in the same set.

4. sumOfSubsets.c : Given three integer arrays and one integer value k. We need to find one element form each array whose sum is equal to the given number k.
